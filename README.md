This project builds a machine learning system to predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) likelihood from questionnaire responses. It applies data preprocessing to handle missing values, balance class distribution, and standardize features for optimal performance. Multiple models, including Logistic Regression and XGBoost, are trained and compared, with SHAP explainability used to identify key factors influencing predictions. The best-performing model is deployed via a Flask web app, allowing users to complete the questionnaire online and instantly receive an “Autism: Yes/No” result.
